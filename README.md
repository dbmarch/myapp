Goals for the App:

1) Use firebase to save photos
2) Provide interface to log in and access photos 
3) ability to upload, delete, tag photos.

- Status of the app

Able to log into firebase.   Have issues with crossdomain access
To display images locally we can just render a link.  Uploading needs us to generate the bitmap and transfer.

Have some of the upload/download working but I don't like the fact that I can't list the images in firebase.  I would have to store the names in the database ( or hardcode names).

I think I am going to shelve this and start over using my GCP account and compute engine.
